# Floop Examples

Floop is trivial to use, but some examples are provided from the simplest usage to animating Widgets.

From simplest to more sophisticated the order is the following:

- cliker.dart  (most basic)
- icon_thumbnails.dart  (creates own store)
- drag_circle.dart  (animated)
- animated_icons.dart  (animated using Repeater)
